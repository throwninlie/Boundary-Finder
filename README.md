# BoundaryFinder
Curve fitting web demo game

To test, start by downloading all the files in this folder. Open the index.html file in your local browser.

Still under development, so the UI isn't super intuitive, but below are the basic steps to play:

1) Click on a red hex tile to 'observe' a time step

2) Click on the 'Infer Boundary' button (should be red after click) to be able to infer the boundary/river and change tile colors to orange

3) Click on the 'Infer Boundary' button again (should be blue again after click) to move to the next observation (red hex tile). Repeat step #1 until no more red hex tiles appear.
